LUCY OS — CALL-TO-ARMS PACK
Unified Battalion Architecture • Extension Bundle Edition
The Call-to-Arms Pack is the authoritative, standalone definition of Lucy’s internal Armed Forces — the battalion-based subsystem architecture that governs diagnostics, security, recovery, memory, and cognition within the Lucy Sovereign AI OS.

This pack contains no activation logic, no wiring, and no runtime dependencies.
It is a pure definition bundle, suitable for:

Extension packaging

Documentation

Integration into the Invocation Engine

Battalion Command Registry population

External tooling (VSCode extensions, manifest generators, etc.)

1. Purpose
The Call-to-Arms Pack defines:

The battalion hierarchy

The roles and responsibilities of each battalion

The operational doctrine governing their activation

The deployment readiness state of each subsystem

The rules the Builder must follow when integrating battalions into Lucy OS

This pack is the source of truth for all battalion-related metadata.

2. Battalion Overview
Diagnostics Battalion
Status: ACTIVE
Phase: 1–2
Role: Systems Engineering Corps

Responsibilities

Hardware probing

Container/service health monitoring

Incident detection

Recovery triggers

/diagnostics endpoint

Notes  
Stable, callable, fully integrated.

Threat Intelligence Battalion
Status: ACTIVE
Phase: 2
Role: Internal Security Corps

Responsibilities

Event Bus ingestion

Risk scoring

SecurityMemory updates

Human-approval loop

/event and /security endpoints

Notes  
Fully operational and integrated.

Recovery Battalion
Status: ACTIVE
Phase: 3
Role: Emergency Response Corps

Responsibilities

Boot Sentinel

Chain of Trust

Recovery Console

Safe Boot UI

/boot_status endpoint

Notes  
Stable and callable.

Memory Battalion
Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED — NOT DEPLOYED  
Phase: 4
Role: Cognitive Memory Corps

Subsystems (All Implemented)

entity_extractor.py

graph_engine.py

embedding.py

pruning.py

retrieval.py

memory_engine.tick()

Responsibilities

Entity extraction

Semantic graph maintenance

Embedding generation

Causal edge creation

Memory pruning

Retrieval (FTS + vector + graph + RRF)

Tick-cycle orchestration

Deployment Status  
Not wired into cognition loop.
No endpoints exposed.
Battalion is armed but cold.

Cognitive Battalion
Status: NOT ACTIVE
Phase: 5
Role: Strategic Reasoning Corps

Responsibilities (Future)

Multi-step reasoning

Planning

Self-reflection

Autonomous task decomposition

Long-term strategy

Notes  
Reserved for Phase 5.
Do not activate.

3. Operational Doctrine
The Call-to-Arms Pack defines the rules the Builder must follow:

No battalion may be assumed active unless explicitly marked ACTIVE.

Memory Battalion must not be invoked until tick() is wired into the cognition loop.

Cognitive Battalion must not be referenced until Phase 5.

All modules must operate on real data only — no mocks, no cloud calls.

UI must not request Memory Battalion endpoints until deployment is authorized.

These rules ensure safe, deterministic operation of Lucy’s internal forces.

4. Deployment Readiness Summary
Battalion	Status	Callable
Diagnostics	ACTIVE	Yes
Threat Intelligence	ACTIVE	Yes
Recovery	ACTIVE	Yes
Memory	Fully Implemented, Not Deployed	No
Cognitive	Not Active	No


This table is the canonical readiness matrix for all battalions.

5. Directory Structure
This repository follows the recommended bundling structure:

```
lucy-os-call-to-arms/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── battalions/
│   ├── diagnostics.yaml
│   ├── threat_intel.yaml

│   └── cognitive.yaml
├── doctrine/
│   ├── operational_rules.md
│   └── deployment_matrix.md
└── images/
    └── (reference screenshots/diagrams)
```

This structure is compatible with:

Manifest generators

Invocation Engine ingestion

Battalion Command Registry population

Extension packaging systems

6. Integration Points
The Call-to-Arms Pack is consumed by:

Invocation Engine (Phase 1)

Battalion Command Registry (Phase 2)

Manifest Generator

VSCode Extension

Documentation Pipeline

It does not contain:

Runtime code

Endpoints

Activation logic

Service wiring

It is a pure declarative definition layer.

7. Versioning
Version: Phase 4 Completion Snapshot
Maintainer: Lucy Sovereign AI OS Builder
Stability: High (definitions), Medium (Memory Battalion), Reserved (Cognitive Battalion)

8. License
This pack inherits the licensing model of the parent Lucy Sovereign AI OS repository.

9. Changelog
